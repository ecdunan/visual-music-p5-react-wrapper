P5 Intergration with React for Visual Music

<a href="https://github.com/and-who/react-p5-wrapper">react-p5-wrapper</a> was used to draw the visualization in P5 while the sound controls were implemented in react. The states were then passed down as props to the canvas to trigger a redraw and change the visualization based on the sound's amplitued.

The sketch file was passed down as props in the P5Wrapper to load the P5 functions.
In the sketch.js, the p5.sound and p5.dom addons needed to be imported manually since the wrapper doesn't recognize some of the functions when imported alone.

<strong>myCustomRedrawAccordingToNewPropsHandler</strong> function with the props as parameter was then implemented to monitor if any state changes like loading a song, clicking the play/pause button, using the volume slider was performed to redraw the canvas with the new values.
